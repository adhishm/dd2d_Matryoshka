 * @brief Definition of the member functions of the DislocationSource class.
 * @details This file defines the member functions of the DislocationSource class representing a source of dislocations in the simulation. This class inherits from the Defect class. This object is basically the representation of a Frank-Read source emitting dislocation dipoles. When the dislocation source experiences a shear stress greater than a critical value for a certain amount of time (or number of iterations), it emits a dislocation dipole with a length that is a function of the applied stress.
